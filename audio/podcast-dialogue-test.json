        { "speaker": 2, "text": "Yeah, and specifically how to protect it. Because there's actually a lot of money that just... leaks out of the system." },

        { "speaker": 1, "text": "So let's start with the basics. How do restaurants make money?" },
        { "speaker": 2, "text": "Well, there's really three channels, right? Dine-in, takeout, and delivery." },
        { "speaker": 1, "text": "Right. And with dine-in, you see the customer. You control the whole experience." },
        { "speaker": 2, "text": "Takeout is similar. They walk in, grab their food, leave. Pretty straightforward." },
        { "speaker": 1, "text": "But delivery... [sighs] that's where things get complicated." },
        { "speaker": 2, "text": "Because your food goes to someone you've never met. And once it leaves your kitchen, you have no idea what happens next." }

        { "speaker": 1, "text": "But then the platform takes over. DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub..." },
        { "speaker": 2, "text": "They own the customer relationship. They handle the payment. They do the delivery." },
        { "speaker": 1, "text": "And here's the thing that really gets me. When something goes wrong?" },
        { "speaker": 2, "text": "The customer complains to the platform, not the restaurant." },
        { "speaker": 1, "text": "Exactly! You have zero direct recourse. None." }

        { "speaker": 1, "text": "Picture this. Inside the store, everything looks great. Busy kitchen, staff working, orders flowing." },
        { "speaker": 2, "text": "Okay..." },
        { "speaker": 1, "text": "But on the delivery app? The store shows as unavailable. Completely invisible." },
        { "speaker": 2, "text": "Oh wow. So customers literally can't see them." },
        { "speaker": 1, "text": "Right! And the worst part? Nobody inside the restaurant even knows it's happening." },
        { "speaker": 2, "text": "That's revenue that never even gets a chance to happen. That's terrifying actually." }
